# 🧐 Backstory

Not affliated with any govt agency. By no means an official source of information.

WEN BOOSTER is a simple date calculator birth out of the frequent reminders to receive booster shots yet much uncertainty over vaccination status <a
href="https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/4406847806361--Booster-What-will-my-Vaccination-status-show-after-I-ve-taken-my-booster" title="vac status 14th Feb">once the clock strikes 12</a> on the 14th Feb 2021.You will still be considered fully vaccinated as long as you're within the 270 days from last effective date.

This app is currently only targeted and somewhat useful for people who have received their primary
vaccination series and yet to take booster shot.

You should see only an "effective from" date in the app now which will be replaced by a "valid till"
come 14th Feb. After you take the booster jab, it takes 1-3 days for your status to be updated.

Development effort: ~1 day for core features, ~1.5 days for sketching + simple UI/UX design + bug fixing based on feedbacks from friends
